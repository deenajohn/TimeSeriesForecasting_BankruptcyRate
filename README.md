# Time Series Modeling of Bankruptcy Rates

Forecasted Canada's monthly bankruptcy rate for two years using historical data as well external factors such as unemployment rate, population and housing price index.

Created an ensemble of models using  ARIMA, ARIMAX, SARIMAX, Holt-Winters and Exponential Smoothing in R for accurate predictions and preventing overfitting. Further, conducted residual diagnostics to ensure model validity.
